# TheDAO Museum

## About

This project is an Ethereum blokchain archeology project.

TheDAO token (DAO) is probably a token with the most historic significance on Ethereum. It has been mostly forgotten and left to rot, de-listed from exchanges, removed from market-cap tracking sites.

Delisted from everywhere, except Uniswap that is! However, because the token contract is missing the 'decimals' and 'symbol' properties, it won't work with the current Uniswap UI. 

Therefore, this project provides a simple UI for the Uniswap V2 TheDAO pool, that lets you buy and sell the original DAO token.

For the first time, the TheDAO is unearthed, and meets web3. Now that we have DeFi, who knows where else it can go? If anything, the token itself should be a nice collector's item.
